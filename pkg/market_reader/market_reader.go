// IMarketReader defines an interface for reading market data from some market data provider. The Market Reader
// is used to implement the method of triggering the read from the market data source. For example, a MarketReader
// could be a scheduled read every 5 seconds, run once, a file, or trigger on an API POST to some HTTP endpoint.
// The MarketReader is intended to operate on a separate thread so it can read market data asynchronously and post the result
// To a channel for processing in some other thread.

	// SetMarketProvider assigns the MarketDataProvider so this implementation can request the data to be retrieved.

	// Initialise configures all of the required runtime parameters and must be the first method called.

	// GetFxPricing initiates the retrieval of the market data from the provider. It defined the go channel for providing the results,
	// a separate channel for controlling shutdown, a list of currencies to retrieve the FX details for, the base Currency for the FX,
	// and a date stamp to filter the FX data on.
